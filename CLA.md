# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **PuckHub**!

To clarify the intellectual property rights granted with contributions from any person or entity, Sascha Grüßhaber (the "Project Owner") must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each contributor.

This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project Owner and the project's users; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

## Agreement

By submitting a contribution (whether through a pull request, issue, email, or any other form), you agree to the following terms:

This license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination with the Software.

### 4. Your Representations

You represent that:

1. **Original Work**: You are the original author of the Contribution, or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this Agreement.

   - You have received permission to make the Contribution on behalf of that employer, OR
   - Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contribution, OR
   - Your employer has executed a separate CLA with the Project Owner

3. **No Conflicts**: Your Contribution does not violate any agreement You have with any third party.

   - You have the right to submit it under this Agreement, AND

### 5. No Support Obligation

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.

### 6. Ownership

You retain ownership of the copyright in Your Contribution. This Agreement does not transfer ownership to the Project Owner.

### 7. Notification

You agree to notify the Project Owner if You become aware that any of Your representations in this Agreement are inaccurate.

### 8. Disclaimer
